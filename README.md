  * In addition, a permission has been sent by the owner of 2minutetabletop.com (can be shared on demand): *Thanks Paul, it looks like a useful pack! I think ​the attribution in the token names that you suggested would be great. "Barghest (from 2-Minute Tabletop)" for example. Can you please also mention us when you share preview images with the tokens visible? We often get concerned emails wondering if our art is being stolen when this attribution is left out. With those two requirements you have our permission to use our tokens in this pack, so long as it is shared non-commercially. :) Thank you, – Ross*
  * As requested, the tokens have the right name and 2mintabletop is credited in the documentation.
